# Collaborators

We are using external collaborators in our orgs but they have one big drawback from a management PoV and that is off-boarding.
I would like to be able to on/off board collaborators that ARE federated users, but are not part of the enterprise.
We have such a set of users that work in other IKEA group companes or with partners. They can get access to selected repos, but we do not want them to get automatic access to all repos with "internal" visibility.
